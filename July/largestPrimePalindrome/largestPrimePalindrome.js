/*
 * Create a function that returns the largest prime palindrome less than 1000.
 * Hint: it's 929
 * You will first want to determine if the number is a palindrome and then determine if it is prime.
 * A palindrome is a number that is the same forwards and backwards: 121, 323, 123454321, etc.
 * Extra credit: Modify the function to look for the largest prime palindrome less than any provided number.
 * Extra credit 2: How can you improve the time complexity?  (Google: Sieve of Eratosthenes)
